Feature: Move email with attachments to a folder
  Background:



    #Summary: This test composes and sends a message with attachments, moves it to another folder, and: verifies the message content, checks privacy status and opens attachments.
  #Description: This test scenario involves composing and sending a message with attachments, moving the message to the "spam" folder, and performing various actions on the message. It includes entering the sender's own email address, subject, and message content. Attachments such as a PDF, MS Office file, and a picture are added to the message. After sending the message, the test verifies that it has been received and clicks on it. The message is then moved to the "spam" folder, and the test navigates back to the inbox. Next, the test selects the "spam" folder and clicks on the first message within it. It compares the message body with an expected value stored in a JSON file and checks the privacy status. The test proceeds to open three attached files and then returns to the previous screen. Finally, the test navigates back to the inbox folder from the navigation menu. These steps outline the overall flow of the Cucumber test scenario.
