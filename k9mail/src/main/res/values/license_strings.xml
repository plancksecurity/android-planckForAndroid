Furthermore, You acknowledge and agree that the source and object code of the Applications and the format, directories, queries, algorithms, structure and organization of the p≡p Application are the intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information of pEp Security SA and its affiliates, licensors and suppliers. Except as expressly stated in this License, You are not granted any intellectual property rights in or to the p≡p Application by implication, estoppel or other legal theory, and all rights in and to the p≡p Application not expressly granted in this License are hereby reserved and retained by pEp Security SA.

You acknowledge and agree that Your right to use such Third Party Software as part of the p≡p Application is subject to and governed by the terms and conditions of the Free Software or third party license applicable to such Third Party Software, including, without limitation, any applicable acknowledgements, license terms and disclaimers contained therein. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this License and the terms of such Free Software or third party licenses, the terms of the Free Software or third party licenses shall control with regard to Your use of the relevant Third Party Software.

        <br><br> <b>5. Use of Information.</b>

        <br><br> <b>5.1 Consent to Use Information.</b> pEp Security SA is a privacy project, and takes care that Your privacy will be respected. You agree, that pEp Security SA is storing and managing data about You, which is needed to fulfill the requirements of law and of all contracts, which You and pEp Security SA close. However, you may additionally grant pEp Security SA the right to collect statistical and usage data with the product You are using. In any such case, You are in control and can enable and disable data collection with easily reachable user interface. By enabling such functionality, you grant the right of usage of all collected data to pEp Security SA without restrictions; all such data then goes to the ownership of pEp Security SA. By disabling such functionality, you revoke this right for newly collected data, but not for formerly collected data where your acceptance was formerly given. Additionally to such data, You agree that there is technical, statistical and usage data collected and stored by the web system of pEp Security SA and the shop systems of pEp Security SA or third party, where products of pEp Security SA are described and deployed. For all data pEp Security SA has stored about You, pEp Security SA is intending not to violate privacy at all, and therefore never is profiling single people or storing any unneeded personal data. You have the right for receiving a copy of all personal data pEp Security SA is storing about You. Furthermore, you have the right to decide that pEp Security SA must delete all personal data about You, except such data, which pEp Security SA is legally bound to store (like invoice data for bookkeeping et.al.). pEp Security SA never sells personal data about you to third party, like address dealers.

        <br><br> <b>5.2 Privacy Policy.</b> pEp Security SA is following a strict path of keeping Your privacy. There is no complicated Privacy Policy needed, because pEp Security SA only collects, manages and uses your data following the Consent to Use Information in 5.1.
